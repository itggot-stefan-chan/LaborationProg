*** Assignment 1 The Pig game ***

We are going to implement the dice game "Pig".
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_%28dice_game%29

1.  The game should run inside the program() method (calling other methods from there)
    See below for a run of the game. Some methods are already implemented, use if you like.
    There is also a class for Players. You must use it.

    If new to programming you should make a plan first.
    - Sketch flow in program() using "smallest step" tactics. If step complicated use functional
      decomposition i.e. assume you have a method (even if not complicated preferably use a method
      to "get a name" for what we're doing).
    - Discuss with assistant before start implementing!
    - Implement and test logical methods one at a time, see call to test() first in program()
    - Make a clear separation of IO methods and game logic methods

    A run of the game:

    Welcome to PIG!
    First player to get 20 points will win!
    Commands are: r = roll , n = next, q = quit

    How many players? > 2
    Name for player 1 > olle
    Name for player 2 > fia
    Points: olle = 0 fia = 0
    Player is olle > r
    Got 6 running total are 6
    Player is olle > r
    Got 6 running total are 12
    Player is olle > r
    Got 3 running total are 15
    Player is olle > r
    Got 1 lost it all!
    Points: olle = 0 fia = 0
    Player is fia > r
    Got 2 running total are 2
    Player is fia > r
    Got 1 lost it all!
    Points: olle = 0 fia = 0
    Player is olle > r
    Got 2 running total are 2
    Player is olle > r
    Got 2 running total are 4
    Player is olle > r
    Got 1 lost it all!
    Points: olle = 0 fia = 0
    Player is fia > r
    Got 5 running total are 5
    Player is fia > r
    Got 3 running total are 8
    Player is fia > n
    Points: olle = 0 fia = 8
    Player is olle > r
    Got 6 running total are 6
    Player is olle > r
    Got 3 running total are 9
    Player is olle > n
    Points: olle = 9 fia = 8
    Player is fia > r
    Got 1 lost it all!
    Points: olle = 9 fia = 8
    Player is olle > r
    Got 1 lost it all!
    Points: olle = 9 fia = 8
    Player is fia > r
    Got 2 running total are 2
    Player is fia > r
    Got 5 running total are 7
    Player is fia > r
    Got 6 running total are 13
    Game over! Winner is player fia with 21 points (if q chosen prints: Game aborted)

2. (Optional). Add a computer player (AI) to the program. A simple approach i just to name
    some player "computer". More complex solution would be to create a class for the Computer
    (possibly exchange a computer player with someone else's and let them play against each other).
    A run of program could look like:


    Welcome to PIG!
    First player to get 20 points will win!
    Commands are: r = roll , n = next, q = quit

    How many players? > 2
    Name for player 1 > olle
    Name for player 2 > fia
    Points: computer = 0 olle = 0 fia = 0
    Player is fia > r
    Got 3 running total are 3
    Player is fia > n
    Points: computer = 0 olle = 0 fia = 3
    Player is computer
    computer choose: r
    Got 5 running total are 5
    Player is computer
    computer choose: r
    Got 2 running total are 7
    Player is computer
    computer choose: n
    Points: computer = 7 olle = 0 fia = 3
    Player is olle > r
    Got 6 running total are 6
    Player is olle > n
    Points: computer = 7 olle = 6 fia = 3
    Player is fia > r
    Got 2 running total are 2
    etc...
